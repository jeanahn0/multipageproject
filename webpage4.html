I am a junior at Northeastern University pursuing Business Administration and Design, with a concentration in Marketing Analytics. 

I go by my middle name, love going to the MFA on Wednesday afternoons, collect postcards for fun, and am obsessed with quokkas. But most importantly, I like to share what I've experienced and learned through my artworks. 

Although I'm interested in all aspects of design, I specifically love typography and logo design, which integrates the two fields of business and design. Recently, I’ve also discovered a new interest in data analytics, and I am constantly trying to connect design and marketing/data analytics.</div>
